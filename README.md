# **The Effect of Familiarity on EEG**
*Kaushika Uppu, Zairan Xiang, Duc Vo*

The goal of this project was to analyze EEG data in order to examine the differences in brain responses to familiar vs. unfamiliar music, specifically in the frontal regions, which have previously been associated with attention as well as emotional responses. Our hypothesis is that familiar music snippets will result in a greater N400 wave when compared to unfamiliar music snippets, an event-related potential (ERP) component that has been known to be correlated with semantic processing, which could possibly be related to emotional connections or responses. We recorded our own EEG data and averaged over trials to analyze the ERPs time-locked to our stimuli presentation.
